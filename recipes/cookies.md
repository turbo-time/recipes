# Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies

Soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies with crispy edges and a gooey center.

## Ingredients

- 2¼ cups (280g) all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup (227g) unsalted butter, softened
- ¾ cup (150g) granulated sugar
- ¾ cup (165g) packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups (340g) semi-sweet chocolate chips
- Optional: flaky sea salt for topping

## Directions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

2. In a large bowl or stand mixer, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy (about 3-4 minutes).

3. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla.

4. Gradually mix in the dry ingredients until just combined.

5. Stir in chocolate chips.

6. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate dough for at least 24 hours (this helps develop flavor and prevents spreading).

7. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.

8. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches of space between each cookie.

9. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until edges are lightly browned but center still looks slightly underbaked.

10. If desired, sprinkle hot cookies with a little flaky sea salt.

11. Let cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.

## Notes

- Room temperature eggs work best for even mixing
- Don't skip the chilling step - it makes a huge difference!
- Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days
- Dough can be frozen in balls for up to 3 months
